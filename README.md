## Setup

On the [project page](https://github.com/TakAjnin/The-Great-Maze-Game), click ![GitHub Logo](http://imgur.com/ORRfQqT.png) and save the .ZIP file. Extract it to any folder on your computer. If you are using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), use the Import feature to move the project to your workspace. Be sure to import only the folder titled `The Great Maze Game`, which is located in `The-Great-Maze-Game-master`. To do this in Eclipse, select `File > Import > General > Existing project into workspace`.

## How to Play
<p align="center"> <img src= "http://imgur.com/RgehIR3.jpg" /> </p>
Run the GameWindow class or the project to begin playing. When you are ready, click the highlighted button to enter the maze. Use the arrow keys to navigate. Be sure to avoid the red ghosts! If you get eaten by a ghost or touch a wall, you will lose a life. Lives are displayed with green bars at the bottom of the screen. Lives can be replenished by collecting coins- each coin has a small chance of granting an extra life. There are various portals scattered around the maze- use them strategically. Collect all the coins and cross the finish line to win.

## Design Paradigm

### Game mechanics
This game was designed with accessible features and emergent strategy in mind. Randomly generated coin locations make every game unique. Unlabeled exit portals mean that players must discover where each portal leads, and use them cleverly to ensure they can complete the challenge. 
### User Experience
We designed easy GUIs with instructions included to make playing the game as simple as possible. The game was also written to be self-contained; once the player wins or loses a game, a menu opens in the window prompting the user to play another game or exit. The game engine seamlessly jumps from one game to the next.

## Credits and Comments
### Samuel Hong - Lead Developer and Project Manager
>**"**Constructing The Great Maze Game was a challenging yet invaluable experience. As a novice programmer, I was exposed to many new concepts- classes, logs, markup languages, and several-hour-long bugfixing sessions. Writing classes from scratch was quite difficult at first- for originality's sake, I refrained from using Java's pre-built classes- instead, I decided to build the project with custom classes. I think this greatly enhanced my learning process. In addition, I taught myself enough the basics of Git, a version control system that I used to manage the project.**"**

### Matt Vanderveer - Maze and GUI Designer
>**"**The most difficult aspects were setting collisions with the maze walls and configuring the GUIs. We were all pretty new to GUI programming, so getting the menu and endgame screen to appear the right way, with the correct prompts and buttons was definitely the most difficult aspect.**"**

### Rohit Pabbi - Photoshop Artist and Communications
> **"**There were many interesting things I did which included setting up the screen to support the maze successfully, properly setting up the main character to move with the proper speed, designing custom graphics to enhance the quality of the game, and more. My only challenge was to get the maze to actually display on the screen, which took immense amount of effort.**"**
